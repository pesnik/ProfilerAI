**ProfilerAI** is an AI-powered initiative designed to create intelligent digital profiles across diverse domains and business needs. Whether it's analyzing student performance to pinpoint weaknesses or detecting abnormal login patterns for enhanced security, ProfilerAI leverages machine learning to deliver actionable, context-specific insights.

## Project Vision
ProfilerAI seeks to democratize AI-driven profiling, making it adaptable and accessible for any domain or business need. By offering a flexible framework for creating and managing profiles, we empower individuals and organizations to unlock personalized insights and informed decision-making through AI.

## Key Features
- **Student Profiler**: Analyzes academic performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses, offering tailored recommendations for improvement.
- **FortiClient User Profiler**: Tracks login patterns to establish normal behavior baselines and detect anomalies that could signal security risks.

## Directory Structure
This monorepo is organized into subprojects, each targeting a specific domain or profile type:
- `/student-profiler`: Code and resources for the Student Profiler.
- `/forticlient-profiler`: Code and resources for the FortiClient User Profiler.
- `/docs`: Documentation for the overall project and its subprojects.
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts for common tasks across the monorepo.

## Getting Started
To dive into a specific profiler:
1. Navigate to the relevant directory (e.g., `/student-profiler` or `/forticlient-profiler`).
2. Follow the setup instructions in the subproject’s README.
